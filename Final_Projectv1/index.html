                -According to the Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook 2023-2024,
                673,000 new pilots will need to be trained by 2043. <br>
            
                -This visualization aims to try to help everyday people and academic researchers to 
                better understand the pilot training pipeline in the United States. <br>

                -The user has the ability to select any level of pilot certification from the years
                2018-2023 to see what states are producing the most pilots. Data has been broken down 
                by Total Pilots per year, Male Pilots per year, and Female Pilots per year, to help
                measure the demographics of who is entering and completing flight training.<br>

                -The question now becomes, are we producing enough pilots to meet forecast demand, 
                or will the pilot shortage that has taken hold of the aviation industry the last few years 
                continue to plague our skies?
