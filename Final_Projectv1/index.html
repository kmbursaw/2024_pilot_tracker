                - According to the Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook 2023-2024,
                673,000 new pilots will need to be trained by 2043. <br>
            
                - This visualization aims to try to help everyday people and academic researchers to 
                better understand the pilot training pipeline in the United States. <br>

                - The user has the ability to select any level of pilot certification from the years
                2018-2023 to see what states are producing the most pilots. Data has been broken down 
                by Total Pilots per year, Male Pilots per year, and Female Pilots per year, to help
                measure the demographics of who is entering and completing flight training.<br>

                - When viewing the visualizations, it is important to note that it is common for pilots in training,
                or still in the early to middle stages of the pipeline, (pre Flight Instructor Certificate), usually 
                reside where their training is taking place. Many training facilities and airports are located in warm 
                weather states where training can be done year round, hence the heavy amount of pilots in Florida, Texas, 
                and California. It is also important to note that Airline Transport Pilots, (the highest category one can achieve),
                reside anywhere they want when flying for an airline and commute via commercial flight to their job. That may also 
                skew the proportion of how many active pilots per state their are.<br>

                - The most improtant fact though, isn't where each pilot lives, but that the numbers continue to increase.<br>

                - It takes an average of 5-7 years to go from pedestrian to Airline Transport Pilot at an airline. Replaceing or 
                growing the number of pilots will take the better part of a decade.<br>

                - The question now becomes, are we producing enough pilots to meet forecast demand, 
                or will the pilot shortage that has taken hold of the aviation industry the last few years 
                continue to plague our skies? <br>
                
                - Below is a proportional representation of how many pilots of each category are in each state for the attribute 2023 Total Pilots.
